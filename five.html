   <pre>Literally,I just hate to be with anyone, I don't want to talk to no one, I just want you in my life for just two times.
Now and ForEver...!

I know forever is a long time but i don't mind if it is spent with you..
I know this is not possible, but I still wonder about this every second.
Will you be my better half?..

And you'll stay in my heart as I knew from the start,
And you'll stay in my heart,will never keep you apart.

Just smile,and i don't expect anything from you.
I'll just live to show this world the care i have for you.

But everytime when i see you or think about you,i don't see another person or think about another person,it is just like talking to my another self and i don't want to share anything anymore with anyone except only you.
It'll be just you in my life to know me for who i am.

I'll soon figure out a way to hack your brain.
Just smile always and just smile.
