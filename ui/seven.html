Your smile is something special, bcoz everytime when I think about it, It mkaes me happy and smile for no particular reason, It just gives me strength to do anything, It motivates me every single second to become a better person, and it shows me the potential which I didn't see in myself.
And I feel myself in many differnt dimensions at every possible way when I see your smile.

I will count every second and I'll be longing  for my next breath.

I just want to say one thing, I don't love you and I really can't because someday soon I'll earn the trust of your mom and dad and I'll never break the trust till I die.

It's just the care I have for you is infinite that it can't even be compared to the countless stars in the sky.
<strong><emp>You are more than a <i>Princess</i>, and my care is more than love, it is like the reason why the sky is blue.</emp></strong>

And i'd like to say something, don't worry about your dad and mom after your marriage because soon i'll be in a position where i'll be with them till my end and i want them to be a part of my life.

My care is more than what you can imagine because not even god can judge the care i have for you, I can and I will go to any extreme ends to show you so.
